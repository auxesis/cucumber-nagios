# SSH sessions are now described using Aruba steps.
#
# For an example see:
# ./cucumber-nagios/features/ssh.feature
#
# For step definitions see:
# ./cucumber-nagios/lib/cuken/cucumber/ssh.rb
#
# For the SSH api see:
# ./cucumber-nagios/lib/cuken/api/ssh.rb
#
# To use the step definitions in your cucumber
# feature files, add to env.rb:
#
# require 'cuken/ssh'
